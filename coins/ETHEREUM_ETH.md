Ethereum 2.0 and staking coming in the next couple of years.<br>
Very bright future.<br>
Largest blockchain network in the world alongside Bitcoin.<br>
An order of magnitude more interesting than Bitcoin, at least ATM.<br>
Foundation of 90+% of all DeFi.<br>
At this point, people are massively locking up their BTC and converting it into tokenized versions of BTC like pBTC, WBTC, renBTC, etc.<br>
Effectively, Ethereum is kinda like a 2nd layer scaling solution for BTC, lol.<br>
It's used so much the gas fees are through the roof.<br>
The biggest problem right now is scaling.<br>
