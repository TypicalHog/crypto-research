A centralized stablecoin (from Circle).<br>
At least it's better than Tether-USDT.<br>
US government is using it to send aid directly to the Venezuelan people. (They need to bypass Maduro's control over the domestic financial system)<br>
No new monthly audits since Feb 2021. Weird! https://www.centre.io/usdc-transparency<br>
