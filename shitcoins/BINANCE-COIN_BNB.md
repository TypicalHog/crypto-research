Centralized exchange coin.<br>
Created by Binance to make them rich.<br>
Pump and dump coin incubator.<br>
Can pump if people use Binance more.<br>
I'm pretty sure most of the "BNB stakers" are actually just Binance themselves, lol.<br>
They really like naming their validator nodes after mountains and famous scientists apparently.<br>
